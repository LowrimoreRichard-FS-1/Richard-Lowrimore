## Part 1: Version Control Summary

Version control (Git) is used to track changes in our project repository. This milestone involves regular commits to demonstrate workflow practice.

*   **Commits:** At least 4 commits are required throughout the week.
*   **Workflow:** Changes are made locally, committed with descriptive messages, and pushed to the remote GitHub repository.

## Part 2: Markdown Syntax Practice

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. This document uses various formatting elements:

### Headings (H1, H2, H3)
We use hashes (`#`) to create headings of different levels.

### Text Formatting
This text is **bold** using double asterisks.
This text is *italic* using single asterisks.

### Lists
*   Item A (Unordered list using asterisks)
*   Item B

1.  First item (Ordered list using numbers)
2.  Second item

### Code Blocks
Inline code looks like this: `git commit -m "Message"`.

Fenced code blocks are used for larger snippets:

```html
<header>
    <h1>Example HTML</h1>
</header>
