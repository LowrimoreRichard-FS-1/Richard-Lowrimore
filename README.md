# Code

The dev folder is for code worked on in this course.

1. For the first milestone, add your portfolio assignment from the Interfaces & Usability course.
2. For future milestones, this is where to add the main project folder.

## Milestone 1 Standup Summary (Week Ending Oct 27, 2025)

This week, I focused heavily on project setup and initial structure:

*   **Progress:** I successfully created a semantic `index.html` file within the `/dev` folder, outlining the basic homepage structure (header, nav, main, footer). The required documentation file was also completed and placed in the `/docs` folder.
*   **Challenges:** Getting used to the specific folder structure requirements took some time.
*   **Next Steps:** Next week, I plan to start integrating CSS for styling and work on the next set of requirements.
*   **Status:** All issues related to Milestone 1 have been closed on the Issues tracker.

I really think I am learning more about repositories now.
